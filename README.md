# Register a food business UI Tests

# Setting up your development environment

To contribute to this repository you must download the latest release or clone the git repo - `git clone https://github.com/FoodStandardsAgency/register-a-food-business-UI-tests.git`

To run UI and E2E tests against a `localhost` application rather than against Azure applications, you must use the [register-a-food-business-environment](https://github.com/FoodStandardsAgency/register-a-food-business-environment) repository to set up your development environment.

It is recommended that you install the Prettier code-formatting extension and the Cucumber (Gherkin) Full Support extension (if using VSCode) for your IDE.
